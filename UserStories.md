## Board of Director

 * As the member of the board director for the travel company I want the cost for the new CMC system to reasonable so that the new system wont have much post launch problem like the cheaper system does.
 * As the member of the board director for the travel company I want the operational and maintance cost the new CMC system to be low so that we can maximsed the profite to be reinvest in other things.
 * As the member of the board director for the travel company I want all the staff to retrained before using the new CMC sytem even if its going to cost us money so that less tech savvy CMC operator can use the system to the fullest potential and benefits the customer through better services provided by the operator.
