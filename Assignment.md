## Problem Definition

In order to satisfy the increasing demand for better customer satisfaction and retention on the phone. While support handling influx of caller. Travel Company decided to revamp its existing Call Management Center (CMC) and integrated it with the new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. This decision has been made additionally to satisfied the demand for the internal team to works more together while increasing productivity and agility.

First, before integrating the new CMC and CRM together. The new CMC need to be satisfied couples of these problems. In order to improve the operation of the current call management centre. Travel company would like to develop an information system that would potentially improve the operations of the existing call management centre. This system will assist both inbound and outbound calls in routing and improved flow rate. There are many aspects that need to be addressed. Ideally, call management centre would like to include a system that could adjust the call flow rate to a suitable operator that could assist them better. This is best, especially when the call centre can be located in one area while it can help the customer from all over Australia. Additionally, In terms of relationship manager's perspective, the system should match customers according to their skills, customer profile and product knowledge. This could improve the call flow rate and indirectly lead to positive customer experience.

Second, before integrating the new CMC with the new CRM system needs satisfied couples of these problems. The new CRM system needs access to the customer database and transaction history from another department. Since the new integrated CRM system planned to include features that can automatically find the user profile based on their phone number or manually by searching their name, this can check whether the customer is new or returning customer so that we can serve them better. From the perspective of the phone operator, this will benefit them since they can see the customer purchase history. Additionally, the new CRM should work seamlessly with the news over the phone purchasing system, in-store purchase or online purchase that the customer profile can dynamically update so the phone operator will always have the up to date version of the customer profile. Since the new CRM system combined a lot of data from existing IS system, it is a future proof system that can be used as a HUB for automated advertisement or recommendation. However, since the new CRM collects so many personal data from the different department, this can be seen very invasive by the customer. Hence, the CRM system has also been compliant with the new user data collection such as GDPR and the new Californian law.

### Relationship Managers: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/RM%20Empathy.PNG 'RM Empathy Map')

RMs need to communicate with customers similar to their profile because it is easier to recommend and sell products that the user is familiar with as opposed to selling products that might be out of their knowledge boundaries.

RMs need to call customers who might be interested in the product offering that the RMs offer because they do not want to call a customer and advertise a product that may not interest the customer, potentially losing out on a sale

RMs need to see customer profiles because it is easier to help the customer make an appropriate purchase if the RM is able to know the customer's needs and wants.

### Employee: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/Employee%20Empathy.PNG 'Employee Empathy Map')

Employees need to have their profile built correctly because this will allow them to know which holiday packages they are able to advertise about and which customers to contact or recieve calls from so that they service customers appropriately.

Employees need to answer the questionnaire because this will allow employees to be assigned to holiday packages that they are familiar with and can provide extra details and insights to customers looking to travel to that location.

### Customer: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/Customer%20Empathy.PNG 'Customer Empathy Map')

Customers need to be connected with an appropriate RM because this will allow the customers to make an informed decision on the holiday package and purchase the package satisfactorily.

Customers need to easily get paired up with an RM because customers want to be able to quickly make the call and purchase their package without too much time wasted as they have other business to deal with in their daily lives.

Customers with a long wait time need to be serviced first because they have been waiting for a long time and will slowly get frustrated until they eventually get frustrated and close the call, not making any purchases.

### Board of Directors: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/JKalair-patch-1-Empathy-Map-BOD/empathy%20map%20board%20of%20directors.PNG 'Customer Empathy Map')

## Reflection

The new CMC and CRM system must intergrate seamlessly while each indivial system can work seperately in case of one system failure. However, at this stage the new CMC is more important than the new CRM system system. Since the CMC system is far outdated after years of neglectant. When the new online booking system, online chatting support and email support introduced. Customer tend not use the telephone to book their trips or find support since at that time the customer feels its outdated and calling customer support have a long waiting time. However in recent years they as using more customer use the digital features. The system and the digital customer support are overwhelmed. Hence some customer started to go back using more phone call since it is faster to get their problem resolved.
