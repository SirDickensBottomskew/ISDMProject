### Relationship Managers: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/RM%20Empathy.PNG 'RM Empathy Map')

RMs need to communicate with customers similar to their profile because it is easier to recommend and sell products that the user is familiar with as opposed to selling products that might be out of their knowledge boundaries.

RMs need to call customers who might be interested in the product offering that the RMs offer because they do not want to call a customer and advertise a product that may not interest the customer, potentially losing out on a sale

RMs need to see customer profiles because it is easier to help the customer make an appropriate purchase if the RM is able to know the customer's needs and wants.

### Employee: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/Employee%20Empathy.PNG 'Employee Empathy Map')

Employees need to have their profile built correctly because this will allow them to know which holiday packages they are able to advertise about and which customers to contact or recieve calls from so that they service customers appropriately.

Employees need to answer the questionnaire because this will allow employees to be assigned to holiday packages that they are familiar with and can provide extra details and insights to customers looking to travel to that location.

### Customer: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/Customer%20Empathy.PNG 'Customer Empathy Map')

Customers need to be connected with an appropriate RM because this will allow the customers to make an informed decision on the holiday package and purchase the package satisfactorily.

Customers need to easily get paired up with an RM because customers want to be able to quickly make the call and purchase their package without too much time wasted as they have other business to deal with in their daily lives.

Customers with a long wait time need to be serviced first because they have been waiting for a long time and will slowly get frustrated until they eventually get frustrated and close the call, not making any purchases.

### Board of Directors: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/JKalair-patch-1-Empathy-Map-BOD/empathy%20map%20board%20of%20directors.PNG 'Customer Empathy Map')

The board of directors need to see positive reception from customers about the new service because this will allow them to articulate if the system is doing well and if it should be kept or adjusted to suit the customer's needs.

The board of directors need to see a positive influence on Relationship Managers because this will allow the board to identify if their RMs are happy with how the system is functioning.
