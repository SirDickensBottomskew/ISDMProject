## Problem Definition - Define Phase

In order to satisfy the increasing demand for better customer satisfaction and retention on the phone, the Travel Company decided to implement a new system in its Call Management Center (CMC) to handle and support the influx of inbound and outbound callers, as well as to satisfy the demands of the internal team to effectively communicate with customers.

From conducting the empathy mapping phase below, it is concluded that the core problem the travel company is facing is the slow rate of call flow as a result of customers getting matched with Relatonship Managers that may not fit the customer's needs regardless of the RM's knowledge of the product. 

## Stakeholders:

* Travel Company Board of Directors
* Travel Company CEO
* Travel Company Relationship Managers
* Travel Company Employees (Employees are employees of the company before they become RMs)
* Customers

### Objectives:

* Create a new in-house Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) system with existing and new features including:
  * Improving operations of the in-house Call Management Center (CMC)
  * Improve the profiling of customers
  * Assign RMs to products they are knowledgeable in 
  * Match Customers with appropriate RMs
  * Help RMs sell holiday packages to customers
  * Create a satisfying customer experience over the phone
  * Help gauge progress levels of RMs

## Design Thinking Approach

![Design Thinking Header](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/58089e358c6d5.jpg)

The first step to solve this problem is to empathise. This involves mapping out Empathy maps and writing down POV statements for stakeholders so that we are able to identify the needs of stakeholders for the system. By applying the empathise phase of Design thinking approach, we are then able to derive the objectives of the new system. The empathy maps and POV statements are done below.

The second step is the Define phase. Here, the problem is defined according to the Empathy maps and POV. The problem definition is then used to develop the new system around it. The problem definition for this project is stated above.

The third step is the Ideate phase. For this phase, How Might We statements are made using the POV statements. These HMWs will be used as a backlog to help solve the issues for the project. Ideas for solving these issues are brainstormed and then compiled in order to solve each problem and ultimately solve the defined problem. The best ideas are kept and the less fulfilling ones are removed.

The fourth step is the prototype phase, where various workproducts and models are made in order to visualise ideas in the ideation phase. These are done iteratively as newly identified issues or adjustments may arise as the project. As each workproduct/model is made for an issue, issues get closed so as to view the progress of the project.

The final step is the testing phase. Prototypes are tested in a practical envrionment in order to ensure there are no issues with the system. 

## Empathy Maps & POV Statements - Empathise phase

### CEO: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/CEO%20Empathy.PNG 'CEO Empathy Map')

**POV:**

* The CEO needs to increase the flow of CMC operations because he is then able to help the travel company and this branch expand and grow in the long term.

* The CEO needs to see and gauge each RM's number of sales because that will help him in keeping and hiring the good RMs to keep the company's reputation and increase call flow and sales.

### Relationship Managers: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/RM%20Empathy.PNG 'RM Empathy Map')

**POV:**

* RMs need to communicate with customers similar to their profile because it is easier to recommend and sell products that the user is familiar with as opposed to selling products that might be out of their knowledge boundaries.

* RMs need to call customers who might be interested in the product offering that the RMs offer because they do not want to call a customer and advertise a product that may not interest the customer, potentially losing out on a sale

* RMs need to view and update customer profiles because it is easier to help tailor a purchase to the customer.

### Employee: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/Employee%20Empathy.PNG 'Employee Empathy Map')

**POV:**

* Employees need to have their profile built correctly because this will allow them to know which holiday packages they are able to advertise about and which customers to contact or receive calls from so that they service customers appropriately.

* Employees need to answer the questionnaire because this will allow employees to be assigned to holiday packages that they are familiar with and can provide extra details and insights to customers looking to travel to that location.

### Customer: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/Samer-EmpathyMaps/IMG/Customer%20Empathy.PNG 'Customer Empathy Map')

**POV:**

* Customers need to be connected with an appropriate RM because this will allow the customers to make an informed decision on the holiday package and purchase the package satisfactorily.

* Customers need to easily get paired up with an RM because customers want to be able to quickly make the call and purchase their package without too much time wasted as they have other business to deal with in their daily lives.

* Customers with a long wait time need to be serviced first because they have been waiting for a long time and will slowly get frustrated until they eventually get frustrated and close the call, not making any purchases.

### Board of Directors: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirDickensBottomskew/ISDMProject/JKalair-patch-1-Empathy-Map-BOD/empathy%20map%20board%20of%20directors.PNG 'Customer Empathy Map')

**POV:**

* The board of directors need to see positive reception from customers about the new service because this will allow them to articulate if the system is doing well and if it should be kept or adjusted to suit the customer's needs.

* The board of directors need to see a positive influence on Relationship Managers because this will allow the board to identify if their RMs are happy with how the system is functioning.



## Reflection - HMWs Project Assumptions - Ideate Phase

### HMW Statements

* HMW ensure RM profiles and skills are kept up to date?

* HMW ensure that automatic outbound calls are not excessive?

* HMW ensure customer satisfaction is achieved?

* HMW ensure that the system works effectively?

* HMW organise customer profiles so RMs can see relevant information, e.g. needs and wants

* HMW better connect customers with appropriate RMs?

* HMW add new customer information into the database?

* HMW connect Customers to an appropriate RM?

* HMW speed up the process of connecting to an RM?

* HMW make the wait time for the customers enjoyable or productive?

* How might we design the system so it could build employee's based on their  profile which could potentially assist them in matching right customers according to their needs.

* How might we impliment questionnaire that could assist them in assigning them with right holiday packages which they have knowledge of

### Assumptions

A few assumptions have been made about the current workings of the CMC:

* System can access customer's database and transaction history from another department 

* System can automatically find customer's profile according to their phone number

* Appropriate budget and project time is available

* All approvals have been received to progress with the project

* The CMC system is able to route calls to the next most relevant RM if the initial RM is unavailable, e.g. on another call

* We assume customers consent to receive marketing/promotional calls

* The system has a way of handling customers with the same Customer score

* Employees are the stakeholders taking the Questionnaire before becoming Relationship managers

* The target list contains multiple products proposed to the same customer

## Use Cases and Diagrams - Prototype phase

### Use Cases:

* **Use Case 1:** System would ask meaningful questionnaire to employee about the company's holiday packages as well as the employee's age, sex, culture and language proficiency. Through the responses, the profiler tool will lodge these details and will be able to detect which is the right product that employee have knowledge of and assign that product or products to the RM

* **Use Case 2:** The board of directors receive a technical and a financial report of the system from RMs at the end of each week. This report will be used to evaluate the system and address any financial or technical disecrepencies. The board then makes a summary report detailing the system's current state and forwards it to the CEO. The CEO then receives the report and evaluates the system based on it, and makes any executive decisions accordingly.

* **Use Case 3:** After every sale made by the RM, a sales counter is incremented. The RM then makes a report including the number of sales made and holiday package sold. This report is then sent to the board of directors. This is to ensure that the system is working as intended and to evaluate RMs so that the business can generate greater customer satisfaction and profits. 

* **Use Case 4:** Once the RM has made a call, the system will display the necessary customer information alongside a preplanned script catered for the sales pitch. The system will respond with information about the customers past purchases, preferences and possible future plans. The system will allow the RM to input any additional customer information so that future calls can be sorted even more effectively.

* **Use Case 5:** Customer dials the CMC number, which then routes customers to an appropriate RM based on their customer profile and customer score. If it takes too long to connect, the customer connects to the Automated Voice Response (AVR). AVR asks customer about nature of package and the customer answers. The AVR then routes customers to closest available RM. If two customers have the same customer score, customers who have waited longer are prioritized.

## Scrum and its activities

The methodology used in this project is the sprint methodology, namely Scrum, where every sprint is one product release, and every release entails a functional system with the final sprint containing the feature-complete product. The system is developed in relation with our clients, in this case the Travel Company, and should be user oriented to ensure that the final system facilitates the client’s requirements.

To facilitate this methodology, a few activities are used. In addition to the previous activities stated in the report (Problem definition, defining a product backlog and defining product release), to ensure effective communication with the team, daily scrums were held to gauge our progress on the current sprint, where we discussed what we have accomplished thus far and what remains for the current sprint. Furthermore, a retrospective meeting was held at the end of every sprint to review what went right and what went wrong to improve on the next sprint.


## Competitive Advantages & Possible Project Failure

The proposed changes bring a vast range of both short- and long-term benefits for the business. Firstly, implementing the profiler tool in conjunction with sorting RMs to specific calls allows the business to obtain competitive advantage over others as it allows customer calls to be automatically routed to the most appropriate user. As such, customers do not need to wait for prolonged periods or need to be transferred between various RMs in order to obtain the information they request. Next, as the system is iterative in nature and continually can be updated and expanded, it can be rolled out in the business in stages using an agile approach. This allows the call centre to continue operations whilst allowing the updated systems to be trialed. This will allow cost savings and reduce the overall duration of the project. Another competitive advantage is that the business will be able to obtain key data about its clients through the call routing software. For instance, if a customer with a repeat history of booking holidays in certain countries dials, the RM can utilise the system to essentially data mine and specify potential sales most likely to be accepted by the client. This also ties in with the unique use of the profiler tool in which RM details are also configured, allowing them to be routed calls most aligned with their expertise.

Carrying on from this, as the system will be able to tailor sales pitches and provide relevant data specific to incoming callers, RMs can ensure that they are able to provide the best customer experience possible. By having the ability to deliver informative and relevant information, customers will be more inclined to progress with sales as a result of the systems indirect improvements to the businesses retention and customer loyalty. Finally, as the system utilises automated call routing processes, the business can detect high priority callers with repeat history of sales, allowing RMs to pitch to customers most likely to purchase. This in turn gives the business a competitive advantage as it will allow for greater revenue and customer brand loyalty.

Overall the proposed changes to the call management centre will allow the business to grow and tailor its operations to align with the expectations of its customers. By being able to satisfy the needs of its customers through the upgraded systems, the business will be able to continue growing over time whilst ensuring that the system is continuously working effectively.

However, should the project fail, the travel company will lose all the money invested in the project, which may be catastrophic to the company as it may take a long time for the company to make up for its losses. Furthermore, the travel company may have to revert back to using old methodologies, which will cost the company even more money and wasted time in teaching RMs and employees to use the new system. This also has the consequence of ruining the reputation of both the travel company and the managers responsible for overseeing the project.
