## Use Cases

### CEO (Checking System Effectiveness)

* The CEO regularly checks with RM managers who provide data to ensure that the system is working as intended so that the business can generate greater customer satisfaction and profits. 


### Relationship Manager (RM) (Using the System)

* Once the RM has made a call, the system will display the necessary customer information alongside a preplanned script catered for the sales pitch. The system will respond with information about the customers past purchases, preferences and possible future plans. The system will allow the RM to input any additional customer information so that future calls can be sorter even more effectively.
